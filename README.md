Idea from [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas)

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

This challenge requires that developer implementing it follow these constraints:

-   Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function.

## User Stories

- [x] ~User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field~
- [x] ~User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered~
- [x] ~User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the the binary number that was entered~

**Bonus Features**
- [x] ~User can enter a variable number of binary digits~

## Installation and run

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`
